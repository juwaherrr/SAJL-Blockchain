# SAJL — Secure Archive for Jazeera Lineage  
*67-404 Behavioral Security | Group 3 (Aisha, Juwaher, Fatma, Shareefa)*

##  Overview  
SAJL (which means "record" or "witness" in Arabic) is a blockchain-based platform designed to preserve Qatari family heritage.  
The goal is to digitally record traditional items — such as swords, jewelry, abayas, falconry tools, and oral stories — as verified NFTs.  
This allows families to protect and authenticate their cultural artifacts across generations while maintaining privacy and ownership.

## Current Sprint (Sprint 2)  
- Completed repo setup and folder structure  
- Drafted the smart contract plan for “ArtifactNFT”  
- Outlined IPFS-based storage and privacy strategy  
- Preparing a mid-fi prototype for the upload & visibility flow  

## Planned Structure  
/contracts → Solidity smart contracts (ERC-721 variant)
/frontend → Web interface (React or Next.js)
/docs → Reports, sprint check-ins, and proposals

## Team Members  
- **Aisha Al-Muhannadi** — Smart Contract Lead  
- **Juwaher Naqadan** — PM & Documentation Lead  
- **Fatma AlMulla** — Privacy & Policy Lead  
- **Shareefa AlSulaiti** — UX & Design Lead  

## Links  
**Board:** To be created in Sprint 3  
**Demo:** Prototype to follow after repo setup  

## Vision  
To make digital preservation more **authentic, secure, and family-owned**,  
ensuring that cultural data remains under community control — not platform control.
